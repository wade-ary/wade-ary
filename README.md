## Hi, I’m Aryaman Wade

I’m a Computer Science & Mathematics student at Northeastern University with a focus on AI/ML Engineering.

## Experience

**Data Science Co-op, CDP (Boston, MA)**

- Worked on predictive ML models for donor retention and giving behavior, optimized SQL pipelines in Snowflake. 
Applied statistical analysis (ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis, t-tests) to identify behavioral patterns and support feature selection.

## Projects

**Reinforcement Learning Agent for Generals.io ([Repository](https://github.com/wade-ary/generals-ai) | [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KUvGMwJkPsz-Hczu0mFMBCC4iljwj6bG/view))**

- Built RL agents using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy optimisation (PPO), training on 3,000+ matches with self-play. 
Achieved a 60% win rate with the PPO agent, outperforming DQN in a sparse reward environment.
