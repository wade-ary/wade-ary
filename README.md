## Hi, I’m Aryaman Wade

I’m a Computer Science & Mathematics student at Northeastern University with a focus on AI/ML and data analytics. 

## Experience

**Data Science Co-op, CDP (Boston, MA)**

- Worked on predictive ML models for donor retention and giving behavior, optimized SQL pipelines in Snowflake. 
Applied statistical analysis (ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis, t-tests) to identify behavioral patterns and support feature selection.

## Projects

**Reinforcement Learning Agent for Generals.io ([Repository](https://github.com/wade-ary/generals-ai) | [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KUvGMwJkPsz-Hczu0mFMBCC4iljwj6bG/view))**

- Built RL agents using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy optimisation (PPO), training on 3,000+ matches with self-play. 
Achieved a 60% win rate with the PPO agent, outperforming DQN in a sparse reward environment.

**Multimodal Social Media Popularity Prediction ([Repository](https://github.com/wade-ary/SocialMediaPrediction))**

- Designed a Deep & Cross Neural Network (DCN) to predict engagement with an MSE of 0.158 by combining video, text, and metadata features. 
Integrated XCLIP embeddings for video–caption pairs and engineered feature interactions to capture multimodal drivers of virality.
